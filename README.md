My solutions for tasks and challenges found on algorithmic practicing sites

This includes but not limited to HackerRank, CodeWars, InterviewCake and miscellanous tasks I've found across the web.

A lot of solutions are named after a corresponding task name on a site. A number of solutions is not.

Not all of them are finished, not all of them work properly, but most do.

This is not a comprehensive list of problems I solved, a lot of very simple problems are not present here, but it's something, and it may help someone someday.

Please read but don't steal ;)
